Vulnerability Prediction
========================

Security threats pose a massive financial and social issue for both companies and end users.  A tremendous amount of trust is placed on third party companies such as Adobe, Microsoft, Google and Facebook to not only keep their systems secure, but to disclose and fix vulnerabilities before they become a major issue for the companies using their software.  This level of reliance means that companies may not be able to protect their systems proactively, as components not under their control, may fail.  In order to help alleviate this, a predictive threat system will be proposed, designed and implemented that is capable of evaluating the threat of software failure on any given day.  Using historical data gathered from [exploitDB](http://www.exploit-db.com/) in conjunction with data extracted from websites on the typical usage of modules, it should be possible to create a threat model.  In addition, using common hardware reliability statistics such as mean time to failure (MTTF), mean time to repair (MTTR), as well as the criticality of the failure and the potential impact to users, a system can be built to mimic a threat scale.  

Interesting systems can be developed using the data gathered.  One such concept revolves around the understanding that, as you increase security on a system, performance lowers.  There are many different defensive programs that contribute to a secure system.  On a server, enabling more advanced stack-smash/overflow detection means reduced performance, so it may be more optimal to enable such features on days when Apache, PHP and the server OS are in a more critical state.  This concept can also be applied to user applications such as Java or Flash where they can be prompted for use or disabled based on their current threat status.

Dataset
-------

The data for this experiment will primarily be taken from a historical list of exploits called [exploitDB](http://www.exploit-db.com/) that is maintained by Offencive Security.  The set will need be cleaned and formatted, whereby it will be stored in a relational database for quick access (an indicative database schema can be seen below).  Data about applications, their release date, first occurrence in the exploit database and other relevant information will be required.  This will either have to be gathered manually, parsed from the existing dataset or scraped from the web.
