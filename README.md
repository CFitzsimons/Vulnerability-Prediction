Vulnerability Prediction
========================

There are two primary goals for this project, the first of which is to create a system that can estimate the threat rating for any given day.  Furthermore, the system will need to identify the platform or service that is most likely to be exploited.  

Threat Scale
------------

Initally this will follow a scale similar to America's Homeland Defence Terrorism Scale whereby there are five threat levels.

The scaling will be based on the time since last failure of core applications and distributions.  Each distribution and application will be weighted seperatly, based on it's potential impact on the population.  Similarly, each exploit will be weighted based on it's category (See [Classification](#Classification)).


Classification
--------------

Following a classification model, each vulnerability will be classified by a number of factors.  Consider factors such as what it targets (application), it's effect (privledge escalation, slaving, data destruction, etc...) and if it targets all versions or only specific ones.
